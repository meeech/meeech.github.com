<p>believe it or not, i don&rsquo;t google my name with any regularity - i admit I actively resist the impulse, so it&rsquo;s been a long time (at least a year, if not more, though I don&rsquo;t doubt the AI&rsquo;s at google could tell you to within the minute).</p>
<p>Setting up my <a href="http://about.me/meeech">new about.me page</a> got me wondering, so I caved.</p>
<p>Overall, no big surprises on page one. page 2 there was an interesting find - i&rsquo;m <a href="http://download.cnet.com/windows/mitchell-amihod/3260-20_4-10119691.html">listed on cnet</a>, in the windows category no less.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it&rsquo;s there, I figure might as well fix it up, have it point to the latest version, and list it in the right categories.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s frustrating that there&rsquo;s no clear link how to claim my profile, and no link to contact anyone specifically about that.&nbsp;Just that I haven't made a publisher profile. I went and wasted time making a regular user account but can't find the path to claim my profile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try via twitter and update with any results.</p>

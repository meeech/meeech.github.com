<p>Do you work with the Shopify e-com platform? You  in Montreal? Then join us (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/meeech">myself</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/hunkybill">Dave Lazar</a>) for a meet &amp; drink! We&rsquo;ll be talking shop, trading tips, and other general silliness. All are welcome.</p>
<p>Where: The Irish Embassy - <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1234+Rue+Bishop,+montreal&amp;gl=us&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0">1234 Rue Bishop</a></p>
<p>When: 6PM, Thursday September 1, 2011</p>
<p>RSVP&rsquo;ing is not necessary, but a quick note <a href="http://www.twitter.com/meeech">@meeech</a> on twitter or via <a href="mailto:mitchell.amihod@gmail.com">email</a> to let me know you&rsquo;re planning to come will be helpful (to gauge how much space we need)</p>
<p>(Should note this is in no way an official Shopify event. Just some local users having a meetup.)</p>

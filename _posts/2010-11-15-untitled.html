<p>So instead of writing a novel for november, i&rsquo;ve committed to finishing some projects &amp; posts that have been sitting around. Or killing them. Usually, there&rsquo;s just one or two little details holding much of it back. Like with <a href="https://github.com/plank/pdfize">PDFize</a> - It&rsquo;s been done for a while, but I knew I had a few hours of tweaking the readme, making sure everything worked as advertised, and trying it out in 1.3. It&rsquo;s still not as &lsquo;complete&rsquo; as I would like, but at least it&rsquo;s out there and can maybe help someone now. Ideally, when I find time, i&rsquo;d like to finish up a helper to complement it.</p>

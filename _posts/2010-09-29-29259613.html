<p>If you are using zsh, with autocomplete and git, then you can autocomplete things like branch names.</p>
<p>I aliased my git to <a href="http://github.com/icefox/git-achievements">git-achievements</a>, and the autocomplete of branches stopped working.</p>
<p>Turns out the solution was just to add this</p>
<p><a href="http://zshwiki.org/home/options/comp">setopt complete_aliases</a></p>
<div>to my rc file. Now autocomplete is working again. Will see if there's any other side effects.&nbsp;</div>

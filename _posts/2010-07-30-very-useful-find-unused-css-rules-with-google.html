<p>Not exactly a well kept secret, but haven't see it promoted much anywhere.</p>
<p>In Chrome's developer tools, visit the Audit tab. Despite it's name, the taxman won't start shaking you by the ankles.</p>
<p>Run the Web Page Performance option. You can then get a list of unused css rules for the page you are on.&nbsp;[[posterous-content:GicalIbkeJljmkJuArBg]]</p>

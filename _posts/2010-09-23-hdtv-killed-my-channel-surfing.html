<p>I tend not to watch much 'tv' these days - it's all about the dl's. But when I do, one thing always bothers me:</p>
<p><strong>HDTV killed my channel surfing</strong></p>
<p>Channel surfing is extremely annoying now. On the web, we're measuring page loads &amp; user interactions in milliseconds. Yet every time I flip, it's at least 1-2 seconds till the channel shows. wtf? this is supposed to be better. At least with the old tv's, you could flip, fast.</p>
<p>Of course, this usually only comes up when i'm in a hotel.&nbsp;</p>

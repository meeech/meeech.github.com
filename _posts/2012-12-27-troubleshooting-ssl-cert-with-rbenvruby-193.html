title: troubleshooting SSL cert with rbenv/ruby 1.9.3
published: true
---
<p>Using rbenv to run ruby 1.9.3-p327 on OSX 10.8, I kept hitting this error in a rails app I was working on: <code>Faraday::Error::ConnectionFailed (SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed):</code> This wasn&rsquo;t happening under system ruby 1.8.7. I found a lot of rvm specific info, but not much on fixing for rbenv.</p>
<p>First (unsuccessful) solution I tried installing updated openssl (via brew) &amp; to rebuild ruby using <code>CONFIGURE_OPTS=--with-openssl-dir=`brew --prefix openssl` rbenv install 1.9.3-p327</code>. Again, no luck - same error.</p>
<p>What finally worked was downloading the cacert.pem from <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/">http://curl.haxx.se/ca/</a>. Install it where you want (i stuck it in /usr/local/etc/). Then, just add <code>export SSL_CERT_FILE=/usr/local/etc/cacert.pem</code> to your .zshrc (or .bashrc) and you will be good to go!</p>
<p>Hope this helps save you some time. If you&rsquo;ve discovered a better way, share it in the comments!</p>

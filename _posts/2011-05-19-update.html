<p>Just a little update. Been a bit silent over here, since pretty deep in <a href="http://www.happystuffapp.com" title="Happy Stuff">Happy Stuff</a> these days.</p>
<p>Happy Stuff is based around the idea that many of us have things we're done with, but they still work, so we don't want to throw them out. Someone else could use that stuff, you just don't know who.&nbsp;Happy Stuff is the easiest way to connect you to people in your area that want that stuff.</p>
<p>Come on over and check it <a href="http://www.happystuffapp.com">out</a>. We're in closed testing right now, but sign up and we'll let you know when we letting people in your area in. You can also follow <a href="http://twitter.com/happystuff">@happystuff</a> for updates.</p>

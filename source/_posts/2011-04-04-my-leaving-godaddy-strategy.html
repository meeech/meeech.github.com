<p>I've decided on how I will leave godaddy, and spread out the pain.</p>
<p>While initially, I thought I would just transfer everything in one shot, that's actually pretty inconvenient.</p>
<p>So in the end, I'm just turning off auto-renew, and will transfer each one as they come due. I'll be using <a href="https://www.domainsatcost.ca">Domainsatcost.ca</a>, who have been working out well for me.</p>
<p>Lost on how to transfer from godaddy? When you looking at your domains detail page, you need to click Manage next to the Locked status, and unlock it, then Send By Email for the Authorization code.</p>

<p>Not exactly a well kept secret, but haven't see it promoted much anywhere.</p>
<p>In Chrome's developer tools, visit the Audit tab. Despite it's name, the taxman won't start shaking you by the ankles.</p>
<p>Run the Web Page Performance option. You can then get a list of unused css rules for the page you are on.&nbsp;<p><img src="imgs/2010-07-30-very-useful-find-unused-css-rules-with-google/Screen_shot_2010-07-30_at_11.22.42_PM.png"></p></p>

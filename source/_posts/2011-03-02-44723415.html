<p>As most of you know by now, i've started a <a href="http://www.yearonelabs.com/year-one-labs-invests-in-dov-and-mitch-amihod/">new venture with my brother</a>.</p>
<p>There is nothing new or unique in one problem we are having: naming. Finding a name is hard. Finding a good domain name is hard^2. Just ask the folks over at <a href="http://shwowp.com/">shwowp</a>&nbsp;:)&nbsp;</p>
<p>When doing some research into the hyphen-in-domain-name-issue, I came across <a href="http://www.pickydomains.com/">pickydomains.com</a>&nbsp;and have decided to&nbsp;give it a shot, and I'll report back whether it was successful or not.</p>
<p>stay tuned...</p>

<p>Started a project a back in Feb - a MailChimp TextMate bundle.</p>
<p>Overall, it's gone pretty well - I levelled up in bundle making.</p>
<p>the project also couldn't have come at a better time - i'm working a lot with MailChimp on the campaign side, so I will be using the bundle a fair bit day-to-day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/mailchimp-textmate-bundle/">post</a>&nbsp;up on the MailChimp blog has some good getting started instructions.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in writing a textmate bundle with php should have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/mailchimp/MailChimp.tmbundle">code</a>&nbsp;- I'm pretty happy with the structure of this one.</p>
<p>I already begun using some of the code &amp; lessons on the shopify tmbundle. :)</p>

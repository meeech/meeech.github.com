    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, my opus card stopped working while in my wallet. I started having to take my card out, and for the life of me, couldnt figure out why.</p>


<p>This has been going on a few days now, and was driving me crazy. At first I thought it was the opus card. Even though i only take it out once a month, it was somehow degrading.&nbsp;</p>


<p>I realized today the problem was a new credit card. It must have some sort a chip in it that the turnstiles are picking up, so they get confused.</p>


<p>I just turned my cc 180&ordm; and it seems to have resolved the problem - the chip in the cc was overlapping the position of the opus card, and even though the cc was further away from the turnstile, it was still being picked up.</p>


<p>case closed.</p>
